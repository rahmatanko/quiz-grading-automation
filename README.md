# Quiz grading automation scripts
1. `scan.py` is a utility for quickly scanning and archiving paper-based student quizzes. Instead of relying on external scanning apps, this script captures the image, prompts for the student ID, and saves the file in a structured format.

2. `validate-names.py` is a utility for validating student name entries in a scanned quiz dataset by dispalying the student's submission on the side for comparison. This reduced the risk of grading the wrong student due to human errors.
